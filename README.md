# advent-of-code-2023

My code for calculating the answers for Advent of Code 2023, this time in C#.

The tasks can be found **[here](https://adventofcode.com/2023)**. Each day has its own folder which contains classes related to that day's task.

Inputs are store as plaintext in the `inputs` folder, e.g. `01.txt`, `15.txt` and so on. Test data files are marked as `01.test.txt`.

This repo uses xUnit for testing, though my tests aren't particularly extensive.
